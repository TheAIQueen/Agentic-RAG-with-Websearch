# 🌟 Agentic RAG System with Web Search Capabilities

## Overview

This repository contains a project that builds an **Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system with integrated web search capabilities. The system leverages **Intel's Neural Chat** model from Hugging Face for natural language generation and utilizes the **Haystack** framework for efficient document retrieval and response generation.

The focus of this project is a custom dataset of **female scientists**, which highlights their contributions to various fields of science. This dataset has been curated and published on Kaggle.

## Features

- 🔍 **Agentic RAG System**: Combines retrieval and generation capabilities for enhanced response quality.
- 🌐 **Web Search Integration**: Enriches responses with real-time information from the web.
- 👩‍🔬 **Focus on Female Scientists**: Provides insights into the achievements of notable women in science.

## Technologies Used

- 📚 **Haystack**: Framework for building search systems.
- 🤖 **Intel's Neural Chat**: Language model for generating natural language responses.
- 📊 **Sentence Transformers**: For embedding documents and improving retrieval.
- 🐼 **Pandas**: For data manipulation and dataset management.
- 🐍 **Kaggle**: Platform for publishing and sharing the custom dataset.

## Dataset

The dataset includes detailed information about female scientists, including their names, fields of expertise, nationalities, and significant contributions. It aims to promote awareness of women's achievements in science.

You can access the dataset on Kaggle: [Female Scientists Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/your-dataset-link) 📊

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- 🐍 Python 3.7 or higher
- 📦 pip

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [ttps://github.com/TheAIQueen/Agentic-RAG-with-Websearch.git]
   cd Agentic-RAG-with-Websearch
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

You can run the notebook to interact with the RAG system:

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. Execute the cells in the notebook to start querying the system. Use the `get_answer` function to obtain responses based on your queries related to female scientists.
